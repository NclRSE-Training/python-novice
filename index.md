The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task:

We are using the GapMinder dataset which is GDP per capita. Which is income per person and for each country we have the data over several years between 1952 and 2007. We also have life expectancy. We have a range of countries labelled with the continent the country is located in.
