The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task:
**data analysis**.

### GDP per Capita
We are using the GapMinder dataset which is GDP per capita. Which is income per person and for each country we have the data over several years between 1952 and 2007. We also have life expectancy. We have a range of countries labelled with the continent the country is located in.

One csv with all continents and csvs for each continent.

## Objective for this lesson

### Data Format
The data sets are stored in
[comma-separated values]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#comma-separated-values) (CSV) format:

Each number represents the number of inflammation bouts that a particular patient experienced on a
given day.

For example, value "6" at row 3 column 7 of the data set above means that the third
patient was experiencing inflammation six times on the seventh day of the clinical study.

In order to analyze this data and report to our colleagues, we'll have to learn a little bit
about programming.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> You need to understand the concepts of **files** and **directories** and how to start a Python
> interpreter before tackling this lesson. This lesson sometimes references Jupyter
> Notebook although you can use any Python interpreter mentioned in the [Setup][lesson-setup].
>
> The commands in this lesson pertain to **Python 3**.
